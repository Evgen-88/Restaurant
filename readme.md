<h2>Main functionality</h2>
The main functionality of the application is <b>to form a menu of dishes that can be ordered by the client</b>. <br/>
When you <b>select a dish</b> from the menu, you <b>create an order</b> that belongs to the user. <br/> 
One order can contain several dishes, so each dish can be added to several orders. <br/>
Each dish consists of ingredients contained in a different volume, one ingredient can be part of several dishes. <br/>
Roles are used to delineate the functionality of the application. The user can have multiple roles and the role can have multiple users. <br/>
