##Application description

---
A web application **Restaurant** was created for educational purposes to study modern Java frameworks.<br/>



The following frameworks are used in this project:
- **Stream API** 
- **Lombok**
- **Maven**
- **Flyway**
- **JDBC**
- **Hibernate**
- **Spring**
    - **Core**
    - **Boot**
    - **Data**
    - **Security**

Two databases are also used in this project:
- **MySQL** database for the main application
- **H2** for testing

##Main function
The main function of the application is **to form a menu of dishes that can be ordered by the client**. <br/>
When you **select a dish** from the menu, you **create an order** that belongs to the user. <br/> 
One order can contain several dishes, so each dish can be added to several orders. <br/>
Each dish consists of ingredients contained in a different volume, one ingredient can be part of several dishes. <br/>
Roles are used to delineate the functionality of the application. The user can have multiple roles and the role can have multiple users. <br/>

The structure of the database is presented below:

The entire functionality of the application is represented in the form of a **user request to the server** and **a response**, **which is formed on 
the basis of requested parameters**. The list of possible requests to the server is provided below
